# TEMPO-Overpass-Data
Using the TEMPO overpass prediction data for coordinating ground-based Air Quality measurements with satellite sampling is an excellent application. This approach allows you to align satellite data collection with precise times when ground stations are also recording air quality data, leading to enhanced data validation, calibration, and analysis. Here are a few strategies to make this coordination even more effective:
1.	Synchronization of Sampling Times:
o	Use the prediction data to schedule ground sensors for peak sampling times, ideally a few minutes before, during, and after the predicted overpass to capture temporal variations and enhance data alignment.
2.	Automated Alert System:
o	Set up notifications based on overpass times so that ground stations can be prepared for high-priority sampling events. This ensures you donâ€™t miss critical measurement windows.
3.	Data Integration:
o	Once you have both ground-based and satellite measurements synchronized, you can integrate them for calibration or data fusion, enhancing the spatial and temporal resolution of your analysis.
4.	Model Training and Validation:
o	Use this synchronized dataset to train models that predict surface-level air quality using satellite observations, creating a more robust tool for broader atmospheric studies.
